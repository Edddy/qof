Version 1.3 (Ian Obermiller)
 - Refactored code
 - Improved speed of populating and rendering the list
 - Added support for multiple search terms (space separated, ex. "fi cpp" will find "SomeFile.cpp" but not "SomeFile.h")
 - Don't show duplicate files (files that exist in multiple projects)
 - Start searching after the second character
 - Added checkboxes to allow opening multiple files (space to check, if nothing checked, it opens the selected one)
